# A Deep Learning based Cloud Intrusion Detection System

Overview
- This repository contains code, models, and artifacts accompanying the paper "A Deep Learning based Cloud Intrusion Detection System".
- The project applies deep learning techniques to detect intrusions in cloud environments from network/host telemetry and demonstrates dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and inference.

Features
- Data preprocessing pipelines for cloud-network logs
- Deep learning models (examples: CNN, LSTM, Transformer-based) for intrusion detection
- Training and evaluation scripts with reproducible experiments
- Pretrained model weights and sample inference utilities
- Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and results visualization

Getting started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (recommend 3.9 or 3.10)
- CUDA toolkit + NVIDIA drivers (for GPU training) — optional but recommended
- pip, virtualenv or conda

Install
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
   - python -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

2. Install dependencies
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

Data
- This repo does not track large raw datasets. Place dataset files in data/raw/ or update the config with dataset paths.
- Example datasets commonly used for intrusion detection: CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD. Replace with the dataset used in the paper.

Prepare data (example)
- python src/preprocess.py --input data/raw/<your-dataset> --out data/processed --config config/preprocess.yaml

Training (example)
- python src/train.py --config config/train.yaml
- Use config/train.yaml to set model, optimizer, batch size, epochs, and dataset paths.

Evaluation (example)
- python src/evaluate.py --checkpoint models/best.pth --data data/processed/test.csv --out results/metrics.json

Inference (example)
- python src/infer.py --checkpoint models/best.pth --input sample_input.json --out results/predictions.json

Configuration
- Use YAML/JSON config files under config/ to make experiments reproducible (hyperparameters, data paths, augmentations, seed).

Reproducibility & Logging
- Seed RNGs and log experiments (suggestion: use TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or MLflow).
- Save model checkpoints and a results/ directory for metrics and plots.

Results
- Summarize key results here (accuracy, F1, AUC, confusion matrix). Include links to generated plots in results/.

Contributing
- Open an issue for bug reports or feature requests.
- For code contributions, fork the repo, create a branch, make changes, and open a pull request with a description of the change and related tests.

License
- Specify license (e.g., MIT). If you want me to add one, tell me which license to apply.

Citation
If you use this work, please cite:

- Maintainer: @jateenG
- For questions, open an issue or contact via the email in the paper.

Notes / TODO
- Add requirements.txt (list core libs: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, torch/tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Add example config files and a minimal sample dataset (or data download scripts)
- Add CI for unit tests and linting (optional)

Would you like me to:
1) Create this README.md in the repository now?  
2) Customize sections (e.g., fill in exact dataset name, model types, training commands, and license) — if yes, please provide those details.
